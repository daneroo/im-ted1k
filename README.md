# iMetrical-Energy TED1K

As I rebuild cantor, and wanting to preserve data capture, I decided to consolidate som previous code. We are going to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)ize the components.

Notes in Evernote for now.

## Components

* Capture
* Summarize
* Publish

## Docker

## Legacy consolidation

* snookr-gcode-svn/green/scalr-utils/
* CurrentCost (SheevaPlug code)
* imetrical-couch
