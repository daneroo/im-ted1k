# iMetrical-Energy TED1K

As I rebuild cantor, and wanting to preserve data capture, I decided to consolidate som previous code. We are going to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)ize the components.

Notes in Evernote for now.

## Components

* Capture
* Summarize
* Publish

## Docker

## Legacy consolidation
Have gathered the code I'm obsoleting into the legacy folder for convenient reference.

* Old startup instructions for `cantor`
* TEDNative.log
* snookr-gcode-svn/green/scalr-utils/
    * CurrentCost|mirawatt (SheevaPlug code)
* imetrical-couch
